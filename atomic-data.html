<h2><strong>atomic_data</strong>: A Multibyte General Purpose Lock-Free Data Structure</h2>

<p>Perhaps every article on lock-free programming should start with a warning that it's extremely
  hard to do right. There are certain subtle effects that lead to hard-to-catch bugs. Also, in
  an attempt to deal with it lock-free data structures and algorithms quickly become monstrous
  and entangled. Is it possible to keep everything simple and avoid bugs at the same time? We'll
  talk about it.</p>

<p>This article discusses two major problems in the lock-free Universe: the lifetime management 
  problem and the root cause of the ABA. Also we will describe a relatively new lock-free 
  data structure <strong>atomic_data</strong>. It solves the above two problems and offers a general enough 
  approach to serve as a foundation for robust lock-free algorithms. </p>

<p>As a reminder, there are three levels of guarantees: <strong>wait-free, lock-free and obstruction
  free</strong>. Wait-free is the strongest: operations on shared data basically never fail. This could 
  be achieved, for example, when reading and updating is a single atomic operation. Lock-free 
  assumes that some operations may fail, but progress is guaranteed in a fixed number of steps. 
  And finally obstruction free means progress under no contention from other threads.</p>

<p>There are two major primitives/ways for doing lock-free programming:  <strong>CAS</strong> (compare and swap) 
  and  <strong>LL/SC</strong> (load-linked/store-conditional. These are RMW ( Read-Modify-Write ) operations, 
  but they are not equivalent. Also important is the fact that these operations acquire additional 
  semantics when operating on pointers.</p>

<p>A one of kind resource on the Internet about multithreaded programming, memory barriers,
  lock-free techniques, etc. is the website by <a href="http://preshing.com/about/">Jeff Preshing</a>. </p>

<h3>CAS (Compare-And-Swap)</h3>

<p>CAS is an indivisible operation (<em>[lock] cmpxchg</em> instruction on x86) that compares an expected
  value at a memory address and replaces it with a desired value, on fail it returns the current 
  value. Using CAS you could implement things like an atomic increment and basically any other
  atomic arithmetic operation. </p>

<p>But it gains additional meaning when used on pointers. Using CAS on a pointer could also be 
  viewed as a rename with a check. Actually <em>rename</em> is the way you do atomic file modifications 
  in Linux (rename system call is atomic if on the same device). Also important is that it 
  establishes an equivalence relationship between the pointer and the data it points to. In the 
  section on ABA we'll see how it plays out. </p>

<p>CAS provides the lock-free level of guarantee.</p>

<h3>LL/SC (Load Linked/Store Conditional).</h3>

<p>LL/SC operates with the help of a <em>link register</em> (one per core). By doing a special read 
  (lwarx on PowerPC, ldrex on ARM) the link register is initialized. Any processing is then 
  allowed and finished with a conditional store (stwcx on PowerPC, strex on ARM). </p>

<p>LL/SC is orthogonal to CAS because it's not comparing anything. It is also more general and 
  robust. But it requires more work from the OS developers: on context  switch a dummy conditional 
  store is necessary to clear the reservation. This also could manifest itself under heavy 
  contention: LL/SC could theoretically become obstruction free (CAS is always lock-free because 
  at least one thread will always succeed).</p>

<p><strong>Now to the evils that hunt lock-free programming.</strong> Here is a picture of a stack and two
  threads doing work.</p>

<p><center><img src="images/The-ABA-Problem.png" alt="" title="" /></center></p>

<h3>Evil Number One: the ABA</h3>

<p>As we observed above, CAS on pointers ties together the pointer and the data it points to.
  ABA happens when our idea about this relationship no longer holds true: the state of shared 
  data has changed (broken invariant) and we are unable to detect that with the CAS (LL/LC is 
  immune to this problem) on the pointer, because that pointer might have been deleted and 
  reallocated again. The ABA results in lost data and invalid data structure.</p>

<p>ABA can be solved in a number of ways: GC, hazard pointers, versioned pointers. Another solution
  is to make the data immutable in a strict sense. I mean, not only the data itself is constant,
  but also the address it occupies is unique. This is the way a versioned pointer works: we add
  a version tag to the pointer and this has the effect of increasing the address space.</p>

<p>It really helps to think about lock-free operations in the following way: as soon as we touched 
  any piece of shared data - we initiated a transaction, and the transaction should behave
  as stated by the ACID rules. </p>

<h3>Evil Number Two: Lifetime Management</h3>

<p><center><img src="images/atomic-cat.png" alt="" title="" /></center></p>

<p>In the above image the cat is an object. The object lifetime problem in multithreaded programming 
  is fundamental because at any point in time shared data could be accessed by a thread. Even 
  using locks won't be of great service here. Again, GC, hazard pointers or using  shared_ptr 
  can help, but they all are not ideal. GC needs a stop-the-world pause, hazard pointers require
  checking all threads, reference counting is a performance hit and might break out of control.</p>

<p>In no way this is the exhaustive description of lock-free programming issues, but these two
  are the most important. For linked data structures there is also a delete problem and we'll 
  cover it later.</p>

<p><strong>Now it is time for me to introduce <em>atomic_data</em> that is a good compromise between having a 
  lock-free data structure and avoiding the ABA and lifetime issues.</strong></p>

<h3><strong>atomic_data</strong>: A Multibyte General Purpose Lock-Free Data Structure</h3>

<p><strong>atomic_data</strong> is a variant of RCU (Read-Copy-Update). Actually, at first I didn't know that fact,
  but then, while exploring, I came upon this <a href="http://www.rdrop.com/~paulmck/RCU/">page</a> by 
  Paul McKenney. After studying different implementations I came to a conclusion that 
  <strong>atomic_data</strong> has a novel design and therefore has some value for the community. But if you 
  feel like that was already done before - feel free to leave a comment.</p>

<p>The one important aspect that divides RCU techniques is in how reclamation of used memory is
  done. We need a grace period - when data is no longer accessed by threads - to do cleaning.
  This way we solve the lifetime management problem but not necessarily the ABA problem. </p>

<p><strong>atomic_data</strong> is a template that wraps any data structure. There is a static preallocated 
  circular lock-free queue of this data of desired length. C++ rules for templates and static 
  data makes it one instance per data type. The following illustration will make it easier to 
  understand.</p>

<p><center><img src="images/atomic-data.png" alt="" title="" /></center></p>

<p>During operation the <em>update</em> and <em>read</em> methods are being called that accept a functor (a lambda)
  as a parameter provided by the user. It atomically allocates an element from the circular 
  lock-free queue, makes a copy of the current data and passes it to the functor. After the functor 
  finishes, the update method tries to do CAS on the pointer to current data. In case of a failure 
  the steps are repeated. On success the now old data element is being atomically returned to the 
  circular queue. There is also an <em>update_weak</em> method that doesn't loop and returns a boolean.</p>

<p>So how do we avoid reusing used data and the ABA problem? That's where <strong>atomic_data</strong> differs:
  we use a backing multi-producer/multi-consumer queue and introduce <em>a synchronization barrier</em>.
  This sync barrier creates a "time out" during which <strong>atomic_data</strong> waits for old reads and
  updates to complete. There is also a nice hack: the backing array for the queue is double the 
  size that makes possible to use two atomic counters to watch for the data usage. This allows 
  reading to be independent of the sync barrier and be wait-free (read the code for more details).</p>

<p>When I got the idea for the design of <strong>atomic_data</strong> I had to choose how to implement a 
  lock-free multi-producer/multi-consumer queue. I didn't suspect that doing this right is 
  extremely difficult! I ran into every possible concurrency bug. There were three candidates in 
  the end: two MP/SC queues with a single-threaded broker in between, a MP/MC queue requiring DCAS 
  (Double CAS) to fight overruning and finally a MP/MC queue with a sync barrier (I think I need 
  to blog about it in a different post). After testing the best implementation was the queue with
  a barrier: it had a simple design, it worked very reliably, it didn't require DCAS and finally
  it showed good performance.</p>

<h3>Memory Ordering Considerations</h3>

<p>To test the correctness of <strong>atomic_data</strong> operation I used an array of some size and the task 
  was to find the minimum element and increment it. Given the right size of the array, the number 
  of threads and the number of iterations for each thread the result should be that every array 
  cell contains the same number: iterations * number of threads / array size. For example, 
  4 threads each doing 8192 increment iterations on an array of size 256: the entire array must 
  contain the number 4*8192/256 = 128 in the end.</p>

<p>For the first draft of <strong>atomic_data</strong> every atomic operation was using relaxed semantics just to 
  see what happens. Guess my surprise when on my 2 Core Intel machine the test was successful!
  What happened? Where is the memory ordering hell? This was my first revelation into strongly
  ordered CPUs. 
  As <a href="http://preshing.com/20120515/memory-reordering-caught-in-the-act/">Jeff Preshing mentions</a>, 
  on x86 the locked instructions act as memory barriers themselves. Also using static globals for 
  the queue didn't left much opportunity for the compiler reordering of the source code. </p>

<p>But that's not the end of the story. The next in line for the test was my Samsung Galaxy S5 CPU: 
  a 4 Core ARM. I created a simple project using Android NDK (thanks Google the C++ compilers are 
  up-to-date and everything works, though some reading and googling might still be necessary ) and 
  fired it up. BAM! Several thousand increments  were missing! Nice, I was looking for this. 
  Actually, I really advise you to get the Android Studio project for <strong>atomic_data</strong> and comment 
  the two atomic_thread_fence calls there. After that fire it up on your smartphone, see the 
  missing counts and then try to place the fences in the code yourself. The puzzle is - using
  the minimum number of fences achieve correct behaviour.</p>

<p>Observing the memory operation's reordering in the act was a nice experience. Slowly I got
  the intuition for what happens and solved the problem. It took me just two release fences.
  Here I'd like to mention the following observation: if a thread reads a variable that's behind
  a release barrier, it means all the memory stores before the observed value has reached the
  memory. I mean, if your reads are dependent then you can skip having an acquire fence. </p>

<p><center><img src="images/ordered-unorder-stores.jpg" alt="" title="" /></center></p>

<h3>Exception safety, limitations and other issues</h3>

<p>The <em>read</em> and <em>update</em> methods - the workhorses - are exception safe. They employ RAII 
  techniques to maintain invariants. There is also static initialization which calls new to
  fill the queue and destructor of <strong>atomic_data</strong> calls delete. Nothing is done there to
  guard against exceptions.</p>

<p>Special attention should be paid to the fact that <strong>atomic_data::update</strong> method is not
  reentrant, because you might hit a barrier and a second call to update will spin forever.
  <strong>atomic_data::update_weak</strong> on the other hand is reentrant. Though you should keep in 
  mind that in no way two recursive calls to this method creates a transaction. Those are
  going to be separate updates.</p>

<p>You might rightfully ask if <strong>atomic_data</strong> is really lock-free since it has a sync barrier.
  Actually, if you think about it for a moment, due to limited computer memory some synchronization 
  is unavoidable no matter what lock-free technique you use. Whether it be a GC pause or a
  check of all other threads or reference counting or something else. Reference counting and
  LL/LC to get around ABA might seem like a perfect match, but reference counting brings
  its own problems to the table. <strong>atomic_data</strong> is a good compromise and its flexible because
  you can adjust the length of the queue. Also a sync barrier helps uncover bugs earlier.</p>

<p>By the way what the length of the backing queue should be. From my tests it seems like 2x 
  number of threads is quite enough. Actually <strong>atomic_data</strong> works even with the queue of 
  length 1 (which I was surprised to find out). Nothing prevents from making the queue
  longer and offset the cost of the synchronization events.</p>

<p>Another often cited feature of <em>true</em> lock-free data structures is the tolerance to thread
  killings or suspensions. I am a bit confused by this argument. After all we are creating
  programs under the assumption of documented behaviour from the OS and hardware. We rely on
  fair scheduling policies from the OS and no spurious kill signals or suspensions should
  happen. And threads are not inferior to processes in any way. The only real issue is 
  preemption and the picture below provides a Concurrency Visualizer graph of thread scheduling.</p>

<p><center><img src="images/atomic-data-trace.png" alt="" title="" /></center></p>

<p>If it becomes a real problem in your program then you can increase the size of the queue.
  But from my tests and was never an issue and performance results speak for themselves (some
  numbers are at the very end).</p>

<h2>Code Samples</h2>

<h4>Increments/Decrements of an Array</h4>

<p>Now comes my favorite part because the design of <strong>atomic_data</strong> allows to create really
  cool things. Let us start with a test that was already described above (Memory Ordering part):
  a number of threads look up the minimum value in an array of some size and increment it. 
  By the end of execution we expect all array cells to contains some know number.</p>

<pre><code>    const size_t array_size = 64;
    const unsigned threads_size = 8;
    const unsigned iterations = 81920;

    //here comes the array
    struct array_test {
        unsigned data[ array_size ];
    };

    //instance of atomic_data, queue length is 16
    atomic_data&lt;array_test, 16&gt; array0;

    //called by each thread
    void update_array() {

      array0.update( []( array_t* array_new ) {

        unsigned min = -1;
        size_t min_index = 0;

        //look up the minimum value
        for( size_t i = 0; i &lt; array_size; i++ ) {
            if( array_new-&gt;data[i] &lt; min ) {
              min = array_new-&gt;data[i];
              min_index = i;
            }
        }

        array_new-&gt;data[ min_index ]++;

        //tell update that we are good to go
        return true;

      } );
    }
</code></pre>

<p>At the end of execution every array must equal <strong>threads_size*iterations/array_size = 10240</strong>.
  Check out the code for this example on
  <a href="https://github.com/alexpolt/atomic_data/blob/master/samples/atomic_data_test.cpp">Github</a>.
  There is also an
  <a href="https://github.com/alexpolt/atomic_data/tree/master/AndroidStudio/atomic_data_test/app/src/main/jni">Android Studio</a> 
  project with this test and you can observe the effects of memory
  ordering on the result (try removing std::atomic_thread_fences in atomic_data.h) if you run it
  on a smartphone with a weakly ordered many-core processor (like ARM).</p>

<p>One thing to remember though is that <strong>atomic_data</strong> guards only the data it holds. If inside
  the update method the code updates some other global or captured data - that's gonna bite.</p>

<h4>Lock-free std::map?</h4>

<p>Actually the design of the <strong>atomic_data</strong> makes it easy to make std::map (or anything else) 
  lock-free. </p>

<pre><code>    atomic_data&lt; std::map&lt;key,value&gt; &gt; atomic_map0;

    atomic_map0.update( []( auto *map_new ) {
        map_new-&gt;insert( { key, value } );
    } );

    atomic_map0.read( [&amp;value]( auto *map ) mutable {
        auto it = map-&gt;find( key );
        if( it != map-&gt;end() ) value = *it;
    } );
</code></pre>

<p>Technically it isn't lock-free because of memory allocation. To make it truly lock-free we
  need to implement a lock-free allocator and the design of <strong>atomic_data</strong> helps: defer memory
  freeing by storing a pointer in a data field and then, in a copy constructor, you check for it.
  Since data elements from the queue are allocated atomically to every thread, it's going to be 
  safe.</p>
