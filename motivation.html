<h2>On Motivation</h2>

<p>The motivation is the source of all of our actions in life. A lot of people don't experience
  any problem with that, there is always something to do: solve problems, get kids to school, etc.
  But others are not content with that, they need a bigger goal in life.</p>

<p>There are two primary reasons, in my humble opinion, for people to excel (not just do work):
  emotions and conscious reasoning. To the class of emotional motivation I refer all of ambition, 
  passion, any sort of satisfaction, and also greed and vanity. On the other hand a conscious 
  decision to achieve something is much more difficult.</p>

<p>When a person is passionate you don't need any specific incentive to act. This person just blindly
  follows her heart and could achieve great results. Especially this zeal is present in young men.
  A young man in his 20s is in a "build my house" mode, so he's also driven by emotions. </p>

<p>But emotions don't last. Almost never. Programmers know really well this situation: we often come 
  to computer programming being ecstatic for the endless possibilities programming opens for us. But 
  as the time goes, we get less enthusiastic and more experienced. It becomes clear, that creating
  something valuable requires the work of a large number of people, takes a lot of time, hard and 
  unexciting work.</p>

<p>If you are such a person that you don't have an emotional stimulus, then almost certainly you are
  going to have trouble with being successful. I have the following advise for you in that case:</p>

<ul>
<li>What would you do if you had 1000 years of life?</li>
<li>What would you do if you were not lazy?</li>
<li>If your life were a 24-hour session in the Minecraft, what would you do?</li>
</ul>

<!-- md bug of not closing list if the first letter is space -->

<p>Also pay attention, that an unresolved gf/bf question could be a serious distractor. You won't
  even realize that what's bothering you is your basic instinct. I want to stress that point one 
  more time: check the partner question, is all good there?</p>

<p>Personally, I have given a lot time to thinking about the primary motives in life. For me money
  means not that much, I have no ambitions either. I love science and mathematics, I am curious
  about physics and space, but all that wasn't enough to answer the question of why I should do
  my best in life and work. One day I realized that what drives many of us is the pursuit of power.
  It is very much like an RPG game where players do their best to earn levels, that in turn empower
  players to do greater things. The same is in our daily life: we learn and work hard to gain
  additional abilities that will increase our power over this world. That power makes our life
  easier and happier.</p>
