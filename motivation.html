<h1>On motivation</h1>

<p>In the first blog post I decided to go a little on the subject of motivation.</p>

<p>There are two primary reasons, in my humble opinion, for people to excel (not just do work):
emotions and conscious reasoning. To the class of emotional motivation I include all of ambition, 
passion, any sort of satisfaction, and also greed and vanity. On the other hand a conscious decision
to achieve something is much more difficult.</p>

<p>When a person is passionate you don't need any specific incentive to act. This person just blindly
follows her heart and could achieve great results. Especially this zeal is present in young men.
A young man in his 20-s is in a "build my house" mode, so he's also driven by emotions. </p>

<p>But emotions don't last. Almost never. Programmers know really well this condition. </p>
