<h1>On motivation</h1>

<p>In the first blog post I decided to go a little on the subject of motivation.</p>

<p>There are two primary reasons, in my humble opinion, for people to excel (not just do work):
  emotions and conscious reasoning. To the class of emotional motivation I refer all of ambition, 
  passion, any sort of satisfaction, and also greed and vanity. On the other hand a conscious decision
  to achieve something is much more difficult.</p>

<p>When a person is passionate you don't need any specific incentive to act. This person just blindly
  follows her heart and could achieve great results. Especially this zeal is present in young men.
  A young man in his 20-s is in a "build my house" mode, so he's also driven by emotions. </p>

<p>But emotions don't last. Almost never. Programmers know really well this situation: we often come to
  computer programming being ecstatic for the endless possibilities programming opens for us. But 
  as the time goes, we get less enthusiastic and more experienced. It becomes clear, that creating
  something valuable requires the work of a large number of people, takes a lot of time, hard and 
  unexciting work.</p>

<p>So what does one do, when all that is left - just sober understanding of the goals in life.
  What should be the reasoning to get that magic kick in the butt.</p>

<p>So here's what works for me: there's a risk, that the cool ideas, that I bear in my head, 
  won't be delivered to the world, and just die with me. That's the first. </p>

<p>The second is a little more aggressive and emotional: the World screws with you, so screw the World.</p>
