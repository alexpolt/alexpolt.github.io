<h2>Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going?</h2>

<p>This blog post is going to be somewhat controversial. It is about our Universe and meaning 
  of Life.</p>

<p><center><img src="images/Paul-Gauguin-1898.jpg" title="Paul Gauguin" style="max-width:100%;margin:0 auto"/></center></p>

<p>Have you ever thought about the fact that if there were no magnetic field, protecting the
  Earth, there would be no life? Or water, or that photosynthesis is possible thanks to
  quantum tunneling, or that the power of the Sun makes everything going, etc. I could
  go on forever: millions of tiny things at work to make life possible.</p>

<p>The Universe, does it have to look like we see it? I mean: planets, galaxies, stars...
  There are innumerable ways to create a universe. It could be some form of free energy,
  that fills the void and where life is possible. I don't know, you could go pretty far,
  you're only limited by your fantasy.</p>

<p>Do you believe in God? A lot of people would say "No! I believe in Science!". But that's
  ridiculous: how could you believe in Science and say no, if the hypothesis about God is 
  not falsifiable: you can't prove or disprove it (Karl Popper). But even more, some of 
  those people would answer "Yes!" to the question about fate! But believing in fate is
  the same as believing in the Lord. </p>

<p>In short, all views about our world can be divided into two major categories: a Physical
  and Metaphysical Universe. <em>The Physical Universe</em> assumes that our world is governed by
  the laws of physics, everything can be calculated using mathematics. It's a materialistic
  point of view, there is no God, no magic, no fate. We don't know everything about the
  Nature, but it's just a matter of time before we figure out.</p>

<p>On the opposite side we have <em>a Metaphysical Universe</em>. This is where things get interesting.
  This point of view suggests that there is magic in the World. There is the Creator, who 
  built this Universe, or designed it. And honestly, so many things become so much more
  meaningful if we accept the Metaphysical Universe, but that is just my intuition.</p>

<p>But how do we find out what is true? We have no way of knowing, God doesn't speak to us, 
  our life is filled with statistics. I was struggling with that question too. Actually,
  my father had one event in his life that could be considered as some proof of metaphysics.
  But how do we know if that wasn't just some personal experience, we need something
  tangible. </p>

<p>Still, this event had left some grain in me. I was looking for signs, and one day I came 
  upon the Prophet <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baba_Vanga">Vanga</a>. I know how silly I 
  look in your eyes right now. But I believe it's super important to have an open mind, to 
  be ready to test even the craziest ideas. This attitude has helped me immensely many times
  (I strongly suggest that you try to be very open minded, open for change, for progress).</p>

<p>So I looked into this. She is very popular in Russia and Bulgaria (she is Bulgarian). 
  And most importantly she is our contemporary. There is a lot of documentary and reports,
  many people has spoken in public about their experiences with her. First, I was surprised 
  with the story of how she went blind. There was a hurricane at her place one day, and a 
  tornado caught her up. Later she was found unconscious with her eyes full of sand.
  That is a very unusual story, and at the same time it doesn't sound like a lie to me
  (who would come up with such a story). Next is the account of her conversations with
  people. Somehow she knew things that she shouldn't have. For example, once a friend
  of Yuri Gagarin - the famous Russian actor Vyacheslav Tikhonov - came to her. She asked
  him, "Why haven't you put an alarm clock on the night-table as Gagarin asked you to".
  He was stunned, there was no way for her to know that. Vanga explained her unusual 
  abilities by listening to deceased relatives. She says as soon as a person entered her 
  house, his or her relatives appeared nearby and talked to her (she was blind so she saw
  wobbly dim figures).</p>

<p>It is very intriguing, but how could all of that help us solve our problem? Where is the 
  real proof of the existence of the Creator? Luckily I have found something that will
  show us the true nature of the Universe. The Prophet Vanga has left us some very bizarre 
  but quite precise predictions. And if most of those predictions turn out to be true then
  there is no doubt, the Universe is metaphysical. Here is what she said about our coming 
  future:</p>

<ul>
<li>Syria will fall, but the winner is going to be someone else.</li>
<li>America will accept a bearded man and realize that love is better than war 
(<strike>Ben Carson?</strike>, <strong>Al Green!</strong>).</li>
<li>A short man will be Russia's leader the whole life (Putin will be the President until death?).</li>
<li>The World will divide by religion.</li>
<li>Europe won't get younger (the worsening demographics of Europe?).</li>
<li>Russia will become the leader of the World, not only in power, but as a spiritual leader.</li>
<li>The Old Russia will get back (Ukraine will disintegrate and parts of it will join Russia?).</li>
<li>Trains will fly on wires from the Sun (levitation and thermonuclear power?).</li>
<li>Scientists will find out the origin of life.</li>
<li>The first contact (with aliens) will happen in Hungary.</li>
<li>A drug against cancer will be discovered and will be rich with iron.</li>
<li>An anti-aging drug will be found and will contain horse hormones.</li>
<li>There is a planet called Vamfim, third from the Earth (Planet X?).</li>
<li>People will dig out a tomb with ancient books that will tell a lot about our past.</li>
<li>Evil will break out from below the ground and sky will darken (a giant volcano eruption?).</li>
</ul>

<p>Updated, corrected prophesies and added new ones (04th August 2024).</p>

<ul>
  <li>Russia's gonna launch a salvo of three ballistic missiles into Red Sea</li>
  <li>Ukraine's UAV is gonna attack and burn down of russian nuclear submarines</li>
  <li>Russia's gonna conduct a nuke test</li>
  <li>Goverment coup in Moldova</li>
  <li>Strongest solar storm knocking out power grid</li>
  <li>Next Starship flight falling back to the sea after engine cutoff</li>
  <li>Terrorist attacks in Russia: one on a railway (in the dream it looked like a tunnel) with massive casualties</li>
  <li>Another attack by islamists on a kids summer camp, all kids are killed, 2 survived (because they went out the day before)</li>
  <li>Trump being accused of obstruction of justice</li>
  
  <li>Elections in Ukraine: Poroshenko vs Zelensky. Zelensky's gonna win with a 90% vote.</li>
  <li>Compromizing evidence on a flash drive on Zaluzhniy is gonnna come up. He's gonna be killed.</li>
  <li>After that there is gonna be a shootout in Ukraine: Zelensky and Budanov are gonna be killed.</li>
  <li>Then Mr. Tinkoff (a business man), Stronsky and Arkady Volozh are gonna be killed (to accuse President Putin).</li>
  <li>The war front in Ukraine is gonna be toppled and troops overthrown.</li>
  <li>Kiev's gonna be captured very quickly with no resistence.</li>
   
  <li>Poland is gonna enter the war. Poles's gonna suffer high losses and loose.</li>
 
  <li>Three bright comets lighting up in the sky (probably an omen of the coming earthquake, 3 days to flee to a safe place).</li>
  <li>A giant eruption and 9 level earthquake will take place. The ash from the volcano will cover the entire sky on the planet (Revelation 6:12).</li>
  <li>Soon after that there will be a volcano winter. And it's gonna be severe, especially in Europe, with seas starting to freeze.</li>

  <li>Migrant storming and fights on the southern border of the USA. With many causualties.</li> 
  <li>A coup in the USA. Massive protests with looting and killings after fraudulent elections.</li>
  <li>Financial crisis similar to 2008, except this one is gonna end up in a great depression.</li>
  <li>Putin introducing new BRIKS nations currency and financial system.</li>
  <li>Japan flaking the western block and joining the BRIKS.</li>
  
  <li>Google introducing next generation search engine base on AI called NextA.</li>
  <li>Apple presenting an electric car.</li>
</ul>

  <p>I have seen my own future in my dreams. I am gonna be merried to a brunette girl called Svetlana.
  We'll have three kids, two girls and a boy. The girls are gonna be blue eyed, the boy is dark eyed.
  The boy is gonna be really smart and start lecturing while student. I'm gonna create a successful company.</p>

  <p>I've seen God in my dreams. Like Jesus, and also like a light source painfully bright. And I've seen my own soul.
  And souls of other people were visiting me in my dreams. Even my not burn yet kids from the future were coming.
  So future is real and time travel is possible (in the Kingdom of God, not in our world), but no changing anything,
  because the book of life is written and sealed by the Lord. And one soul has told me that I'm the 6th.
  Vanga had prophesied that "a long time will pass before the 8th comes, he's gonna be a great peace maker.
  </p>

<p>Is that enough to test the hypothesis? I believe it's plenty!</p>
