##Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going?

  This blog post is going to be somewhat controversial. It is about our Universe and meaning 
  of Life.

  Have you ever thought about the fact that if there were no magnetic field, protecting the
  Earth, there would be no life? Or water, or that photosynthesis is possible thanks to
  quantum tunneling, or that the power of the Sun makes everything going, etc. I could
  go on forever: millions of tiny things at work to make life possible.

  The Universe, does it have to look like we see it? I mean: planets, galaxies, stars...
  There are innumerable ways to create a universe. It could be some from of free energy,
  that fills the void and where life is possible. I don't know, you could go pretty far,
  you're only limited by your fantasy.

  Do you believe in God? A lot of people would say "No! I believe in Science!". But that's
  ridiculous: how could you believe in Science and say no, if the hypothesis about God is 
  not falsifiable: you can't prove or disprove it (Karl Popper). But even more, some of 
  those people would answer "Yes!" to the question about fate! But believing in fate is
  the same as believing in the Lord. 

  In short, all views about our world can be divided into two major categories: a Physical
  and Metaphysical Universe. *The Physical Universe* assumes that our world is governed by
  the laws of physics, everything can be calculated using mathematics. It's a materialistic
  point of view, there is no God, no magic, no fate. We don't know everything about the
  Nature, but it's just a matter of time before we figure out.

  On the opposite side we have *a Metaphysical Universe*. This is where things get interesting.
  This point of view suggests that there is magic in the World. There is the Creator, who 
  built this Universe, or designed it. And honestly, so many things become so much more
  meaningful if we accept the Metaphysical Universe, but that is just my intuition.

  But how do we find out what is true? We have no way of knowing, God doesn't speak to us, 
  our life is filled with statistics. I was struggling with that question too. Actually,
  my father had one event in his life that could be considered as some proof of metaphysics.
  But how do we know if that wasn't just some personal experience, we need something
  tangible. 
  
  Still, this event had left some grain in me. I was looking for signs, and one day I came 
  upon the Prophet [Vanga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baba_Vanga). I know how silly I 
  look in your eyes right now. But I believe it's super important to have an open mind, to 
  be ready to test even the craziest ideas. This attitude has helped me immensely many times
  (I strongly suggest that you try to be very open minded, open for change, for progress).
  
  So I looked into this. She is very popular in Russia and Bulgaria (she is Bulgarian). 
  And most importantly she is our contemporary. There is a lot of documentary and reports,
  many people has spoken in public about their experiences with her. First, I was surprised 
  with the story of how she went blind. There was a hurricane at her place one day, and a 
  tornado caught her up. Later she was found unconscious with her eyes full of sand.
  That is a very unusual story, and at the same time it doesn't sound like a lie to me
  (who would come up with such a story). Next is the account of her conversations with
  people. Somehow she knew things that she shouldn't have. For example, once a friend
  of Yuri Gagarin - the famous Russian actor Vyacheslav Tikhonov - came to her. She asked
  him, "Why haven't you put an alarm clock on the night-table as Gagarin asked you to".
  He was stunned, there was no way for her to know that. Vanga explained her unusual 
  abilities by listening to deceased relatives. She says as soon as a person entered her 
  house, his or her relatives appeared nearby and talked to her (she was blind so she saw
  wobbly dim figures).
  
  It is very intriguing, but how could all of that help us solve our problem? Where is the 
  real proof of the existence of the Creator? Luckily I have found something that will
  show us the true nature of the Universe. The Prophet Vanga has left us some very bizarre 
  but quite precise predictions. And if most of those predictions turn out to be true then
  there is no doubt, the Universe is metaphysical. Here is what she said about our coming 
  future:

  * Syria will fall, but the winner is going to be someone else.
  * America will accept a bearded man and realize that love is better than war (Ben Carson?).
  * A short man will be Russia's leader the whole life (Putin will be the President until death?).
  * The World will divide by religion.
  * Europe won't get younger (the worsening demographics of Europe?).
  * Russia will become the leader of the World, not only in power, but as a spiritual leader.
  * Trains will fly on wires from the Sun (levitation and thermonuclear power?).
  * Scientists will find out the origin of life.
  * The first contact (with aliens) will happen in Hungary.
  * A drug against cancer will be discovered and will be rich with iron.
  * An anti-aging drug will be found and will contain horse hormones.
  * There is a planet called Vamfim, third from the Earth (Planet X?).
  * People will dig out a tomb with ancient books that will tell a lot about our past.

  Is that enough to test the hypothesis? I believe it's plenty!

  PS. Something big happened 2000 years ago in the Middle East. A man by the name Jesus
  came. What was he? What abilities he possessed? Why had he left such a deep impact on 
  people. We don't really know what was happening there. I think Prophet Vanga gives us
  a clue.
