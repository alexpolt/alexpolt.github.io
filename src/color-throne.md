##Color Throne - Brain Gymnastics

  Made my first Android app and released it on Google Play. It's a game, reminds of Tetris, but 
  with a comletely different game mechanics. You need not only to rotate blocks but also rotate 
	colors to make it match other colors. Any matching colors disappear. 

  During programming I came to appreciate a state machines. It nicely partitioned the flow of the
  program. And it made me think what is the magic behind a state machine. It seems to me that
  the following might be true:

  > state machine = flow of messages = message queue = react style programming (?)

  Having a message queue direct your program gives you a great tool: control over execution flow.

  Here is a Youtube recording of the gameplay (image is clickable):
