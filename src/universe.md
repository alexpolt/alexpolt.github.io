##A Couple Thoughts on the Nature of our Universe

  1.  The electrostatic fields of a particle don't stop, they stretch out to to infinity.
      Actually a field is a particle. Fields are not lines, they don't start and end on other
      particles, they simply add. So, a particle is in fact an osciallating wave (3D plane in a 4D
      space) across the entire Universe.

  2.  Because of that all particles interact with other particles. Quantum Entanglement is better
      called Quantum Synchronization: particles are synchronized in space and time. Such particles
      are a whole one because energy can redistribute instantly ( wave function collapse ).

  3.  Gravity is a particle wave moving in a gradient of the fields of other particles. 
      
  4.  Galaxies are formed by a giant eruption from a rotating quasar ( pulsar ) forming spiral 
      sleeves. So, it's like squeezing an eclair. The pressure comes from the strong magnetic fields,
      that are weakest at the poles. The puzzle with the star orbiting speed is because of 
      the gradient.

  5.  There is no such thing as Black Hole because of the speed of light limitation. Quasars are
      the trash refinaries - they turn all material back again into light atoms.

  6.  We can possibly have an instant communication device by having a source of entangled photons
      beaming in two different directions.

  7.  A photon is a traveling thickening of a particle field wave.
