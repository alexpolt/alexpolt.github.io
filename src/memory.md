##Human Memory

  I've got a well developed visual type of thinking (sometimes referred to as daydreaming).
  And I also can multiply 2 and 3 digit numbers by charting them in my head (multiplying 4
  digits is much harder for me). There is a page on the Internet that gives account of people
  with exceptional abilities to remember and multiply huge numbers (like 100 digits, crazy staff):
  ["Mental arithmetic"](http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/history/PrintHT/Mental_arithmetic.html).

  What caught my eye is the description of the education effect on these abilities: with learning
  they diminished. And in fact for me, visually remembering numbers is harder than remembering 
  associated shapes. So, in order to faster memorize the PI constant for example to a certain number 
  of digits, I do something like this:

  I have also observed that the more sensory information is available (scent, sound, visuals), 
  the stronger the memory: so called *synesthesia*. Some people have spontaneous *synesthesia*, 
  like this Russian journalist [Solomon Shereshevsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon_Shereshevsky).

  It seems I have a _voluntary synesthesia_: my brain is able to self stimulate and create sensations.
  They do not feel real and they are not very clear, but as I do more of some imaginary exercise it 
  gets more realistic. Just one example, I can imagine the floor breaks and I fall through. As I do
  that I feel as if I really fall, and if I do that more often then it gets ever more vivid.
