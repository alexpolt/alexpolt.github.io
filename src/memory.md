##Human memory

  I've got a well developed visual type of thinking (sometimes referred to as daydreaming).
  And I also can multiply 2 and 3 digit numbers by charting them in my head (multiplying 4
  digits is much harder for me). There is a page on the Internet that gives account of people
  with exceptional abilities to remember and multiply huge numbers (like 100 digits, crazy staff):
  ["Mental arithmetic"](http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/history/PrintHT/Mental_arithmetic.html).

  What caught my eye is the description of the education effect on these abilities: with learning
  those they diminished. And in fact for me, visually remembering numbers is harder than remembering 
  associated shapes. So, in order to faster memorize the PI constant for example to a certain number 
  of digits, I do something like this:

  I have also observed that the more sensory information is available (scent, sound, visuals), the stronger
  the memory: so called *synesthesia*. Some people have spontaneous *synesthesia*, like this Russian journalist 
  [Solomon Shereshevsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon_Shereshevsky).

  It seems that our brain functions like an associative state machine, jumping from state to state.
