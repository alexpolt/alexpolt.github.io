  * Two essential conditions for being an introvert (IMHO):
    - a more ancient mechanism of attention to the condition of one's skin and body in general (people, that
      often look in the mirror, or often look at skin, overall attentive to themselves)
    - being autistic to some degree (neo-cortex) - strong lateral connections between neurons, 
      creating a possibility of excitaion loops in neo-cortex, highly associative type of thinking.

    >_#define das (*this)_  
    >_das.value = ..._


  * The way *operator<<* and *operator>>* should have been overloaded:

    >*std::vector<int> v{}; int i{};*  
    >*v << 1 << 2;*  
    >*v >> i;*
