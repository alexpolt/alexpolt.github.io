##Resume


###Contact Details

  * Email: poltavsky.alexandr&#64;gmail.com

  * Phone: +7 (964) 791-19-61


###Summary

  I'm looking for a job that is mostly about C++. I have been interested in computers since I was 
  young and over time acquired a good understanding of computer architecture, data structures and
  algorithms. In my career I also had to deal a lot with Web technologies (both server and client
  sides). You can find links to some of **my source code** in the Projects section. Also I have 
  a number of articles about C++ in the Publications section.


###Technical Skills

  * Great C++ (C++11/C++14) skills
  * Working knowledge of the Standard Template Library (STL)
  * Desktop application development in C++ using Win32 APIs
  * Server side programming in C++ and PHP, a bit of Perl
  * Good SQL skills
  * Primary database was MySQL, familiar with Postgres
  * Worked with JavaScript, HTML, XML
  * Good understanding of classic multithreaded and lock-free programming
  * Able to look into assembly output and optimize for speed
  * Good math skills (linear algebra, calculus, trigonometry)
  * Worked with SVN and GIT
  * Used to Bash and Linux


###Work Experience

* **MAIR Industrial Group, Russia, Moscow, August 2004 - December 2005**

  Position: Software Engineer

  Support of an internal database client application written in C++. Fixed bugs and improved GUI.


* **RBC Media, Russia, Moscow, December 2005 - June 2008**

  Position: Software Engineer, later Senior Software Engineer

  Development of web applications based on Apache, PHP (and a bit of Perl), MySQL stack. Building 
  interfaces in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

  Development of an extension module in C++ for Apache server to gather stats.

  During my last year at the company was leading a small group of developers (3 people).


* **Human Stem Cells Institute, Russia, Moscow, August 2008 - May 2011**

  Position: Software Engineer

  Worked on an internal project to develop an OpenGL 3D computer program to demonstrate to clients
  the effects of cosmetic injections. The primary tool was Visual C++ using Win32 API.


* **Independent software Developer since 2011 up to now**

  Took a break from active career to try to develop personal projects. Tried to develop a 
  CMS (Content Management System) and launch a news web site, took part-time gigs, later 
  developed a Java app for Google Play Store (Color Throne). Recently was involved in a project
  with the Institute of Control Sciences of the Russian Academy of Sciences to develop a C++
  application for visualizing data in 3D.

  Was also working on improving my C++. Got a pretty good grasp of the new C++11 standard. Has 
  started a 3D demo engine ( Flower3D ) for which I've created a math lib and my mini-STL 
  ( things like std::vector, std::unordered\_map, type\_traits etc. ).

  As I was researching ideas I came up with a C++ reflection technique described in my "The C++
  Type Loophole" blog post (compile time solution, no macros).

  Got interested in lock-free programming and came up with a lock-free data structure 
  *atomic\_data* ( links are in the **Projects** section ).
  

###Education

  Mathematics and Informatics, Moscow Engineering Physics Institute (MEPhi), not complete.


###Certificates

  * [Mail.ru C++ Gold Certificate](https://certification.mail.ru/certificates/d7f3561b-7cda-44b7-9110-1b0fc35f0285/en/)
  
  * [Zend Certified Engineer](http://www.zend.com/en/yellow-pages/ZEND004080) (LAMP software stack)


###Publications

  * [The C++ Type Loophole](http://alexpolt.github.io/type-loophole.html)

    This C++ hack allows to do reflection of aggregate types in compile time without macros.

  * [nuple: a Named Tuple](http://alexpolt.github.io/named-tuple.html)

    Having a tuple with name tags reduces programming errors.

  * [Useful Properties of String Interning in C++](http://alexpolt.github.io/intern.html)

    String interning in C++ has a lot of useful cases.

  * [Undefined Behaviour and Optimizations: GCC vs Clang vs MSC](http://alexpolt.github.io/undefined.html)

    I explore assembly output of different compilers to show how undefined behaviour and 
    compiler optimization affect generated assembly.

  * Check my [personal blog](http://alexpolt.github.io/) for more.

###Projects ( GitHub )

  * [luple, nuple, Struct Reader and C++ Type Loophole](https://github.com/alexpolt/luple)

    luple is an almost complete std::tuple implementation. nuple builds on it and adds name
    tagging to data. Struct Reader allows reflection of aggregates for simple cases. And
    C++ Type Loophole allows reflection for aggregates containing any types. Code plus online
    samples.

  * [atomic\_data: A Multibyte General Purpose Lock-Free Data Structure](https://github.com/alexpolt/atomic_data)

    atomic_data is a general-purpose lock-free data structure which allows to read and update
    data structures of any size atomically and in a lock-free manner. Nice API and good performance.

  * [Flower3D](https://github.com/alexpolt/flower3d)

    My shot at 3D (demo) engines. Work in progress.

  * [WebObject](https://github.com/alexpolt/WebObject)

    There was a time when I tried to create my own PHP content management system.

  * [ColorThrone - Brain Gymnastics (an Android game)](https://github.com/alexpolt/colorthrone)

    A simple match 3 game with some Tetris elements written in Java.


###Language Skills

  * Native Russian

  * Advanced English
