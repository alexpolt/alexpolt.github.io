* [Dynamic Lighting using Primitive ID](lenin-lights.html)

  Had an idea that one can use gl\_PrimitiveID ( SV\_PrimitiveID ) to do dynamic lighting. 
  Made it into a WebGL demo.


* [Shader Tricks: Retrieving Triangle Location and Edges in Pixel Shader and More](shader.html)

  There are cases when we need full triangle info in a pixel shader and I describe the easy and
  cheap way of getting it (demo included). Also talk about using partial derivatives for peeking 
  into another shader and non perspective interpolation in WebGL.


* [Conway's Game of Life in One Pixel Shader](game-of-life.html)

  Got my little hacky WebGL framework working and wrote a Game of Life shader.


* [Barycentric Coordinates](barycentric.html)

  It's important to understand barycentric coordinates for graphics programmers. JavaScript demo.


* [Solid Angle and Perspective](perspective.html)

  A little about the solid angle and perspective. Also some WebGL.


* [Introducing DFAA Antialiasing Algorithm](dfaa.html)

  I've come up with a an intresting method for doing antialiasing.
