  There are cases when we need full triangle info in a pixel shader and I describe the easy and
  cheap way of getting it. Also talk about using partial derivatives for peeking into another
  shader. And lastly, using primitive id to do lighting.


* [Conway's Game of Life in One Pixel Shader](game-of-life.html)

  Got my little hacky WebGL framework working and wrote a Game of Life shader.


* [Barycentric Coordinates](barycentric.html)

  It's important to understand barycentric coordinates for graphics programmers. JavaScript demo.


* [Solid Angle and Perspective](perspective.html)

  A little about the solid angle and perspective. Also some WebGL.
