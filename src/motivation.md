##On Motivation

  The motivation is the source of all of our actions in life. A lot of people don't experience
  any problem with that, there is always something to do: solve problems, get kids to school, etc.
  But others are not content with that, they need a bigger goal in life.

  There are two primary reasons, in my humble opinion, for people to excel (not just do work):
  emotions and conscious reasoning. To the class of emotional motivation I refer all of ambition, 
  passion, any sort of satisfaction, and also greed and vanity. On the other hand a conscious 
  decision to achieve something is much more difficult.

  When a person is passionate you don't need any specific incentive to act. This person just blindly
  follows her heart and could achieve great results. Especially this zeal is present in young men.
  A young man in his 20s is in a "build my house" mode, so he's also driven by emotions. 

  But emotions don't last. Almost never. Programmers know really well this situation: we often come 
  to computer programming being ecstatic for the endless possibilities programming opens for us. But 
  as the time goes, we get less enthusiastic and more experienced. It becomes clear, that creating
  something valuable requires the work of a large number of people, takes a lot of time, hard and 
  unexciting work.

  If you are such a person that you don't have an emotional stimulus, then almost certainly you are
  going to have trouble with being successful. I have the following advise in that case:

  * What would you do if you had 1000 years of life?
  * What would you do if you were not lazy?
  * If your life were a 24-hour session in the Minecraft, what would you do?

  Also pay attention, that an unresolved gf/bf question can be a serious distraction. You won't
  even realize that what's bothering you is your primary instinct.

  Personally, I have given a lot time to thinking about the primary motives in life. For me money
  means not that much, I have no ambitions either. I love science, I am curious about physics and 
  space, but all that wasn't enough to answer the question of why I should do my best in life and 
  work. 
  
  First, I realized that what drives most of us is the pursuit of power. It is very much like an 
  RPG game where players do their best to earn levels, that in turn empower players to do 
  greater things. The same is in our daily life: we learn and work hard to gain additional 
  abilities that will increase our power over this world. That power makes our life easier and 
  happier. One could notice that is very rational behaviour. It allows us to have a certain place
  in a pyramid of human relations.

  Thinking more on the subject I have found a rational reason for me to try to work hard. It makes
  a lot of sense in my opinion to create new products and technologies that did not exist in the
  World before. Something creative, innovative, not necessarily perfect. Guess that is what I would 
  be doing in a Minecraft session. And also maybe having occasional fun, just to remind myself
  the beauty of the World we live in.
