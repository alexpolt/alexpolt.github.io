##On motivation

  The motivation is the source of all of our actions in life. A lot of people don't experience
  any problem with that, there is always somethnig to do: solve problems, get kids to school, etc.
  But others are not content with that, they need a bigger goal in life.

  There are two primary reasons, in my humble opinion, for people to excel (not just do work):
  emotions and conscious reasoning. To the class of emotional motivation I refer all of ambition, 
  passion, any sort of satisfaction, and also greed and vanity. On the other hand a conscious 
  decision to achieve something is much more difficult.

  When a person is passionate you don't need any specific incentive to act. This person just blindly
  follows her heart and could achieve great results. Especially this zeal is present in young men.
  A young man in his 20-s is in a "build my house" mode, so he's also driven by emotions. 

  But emotions don't last. Almost never. Programmers know really well this situation: we often come 
  to computer programming being ecstatic for the endless possibilities programming opens for us. But 
  as the time goes, we get less enthusiastic and more experienced. It becomes clear, that creating
  something valuable requires the work of a large number of people, takes a lot of time, hard and 
  unexciting work.

  So what does one do to get back on track, if no emotional motivation is present. What should be 
  the reasoning to get that magic kick in the butt. I think asserting your self, your personality,
  growing your awareness: all that has a lot of sense in the given context. It's like a challenge,
  given to us by the Universe. Are we qualified?
