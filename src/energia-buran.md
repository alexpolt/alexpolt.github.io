##Energia-Buran Space Transportation System

  Energia-Buran Space System was the apex of the russian engineering genius.
  Conceived to be an answer to the American slap on the face with it's Space Shuttle, it returned
  a hard blow. Because the Buran-Energia program surpassed all expectations.

  It was an ambitious space military project of unprecedented scale. The Buran was a reusable
  space plane capable of unmanned landing, had digital control system with three computers 
  running in parallel, **emergency crew escape system**. It was designed to dock to the MIR
  Space Station (somewhat ironically called MIR - Peace) and keep it there in case of serious
  political instability in the world, being ready to make a deadly strike from above.

  [Energia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energia) rocket was a marvel in it's own. Heavy lifter 
  that was designed with an outlook of being enhanced to a super heavy lifter. It was supposed to 
  not only carry the Buran Shuttle, but also other payloads, like the 
  [Polyus Space Weapons Platform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyus_%28spacecraft%29).

###That's engineering!
