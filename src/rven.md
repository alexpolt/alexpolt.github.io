###Summary

  I'm looking for a job that is mostly about C++ and computer graphics. I have been interested
  in computers and 3D graphics since I was young and over time acquired a good understanding of 
  computer architecture and 3D graphics algorithms. In the field of 3D graphics I've come up with 
  a new [*anti-aliasing algorthim (DFAA)*][DFAA] ( the article was approved for a publication 
  in the [JCGT][] journal after some editing ). Also, I have created a C++ library 
  [*atomic\_data*][ad] for doing lock-free programming with data structures of any size ( all code, 
  including Android Studio NDK project, is available on [GitHub][] ).

  [DFAA]: http://alexpolt.github.io/dfaa.html "DFAA Anti-Aliasing Algorthim"
  [JCGT]: http://jcgt.org/ "the Journal of Computer Graphics Techniques"
  [GitHub]: https://github.com/alexpolt/ "GitHub: Alexandr Poltavsky"
  [ad]: http://alexpolt.github.io/atomic-data.html 
                  "atomic_data: A Multibyte General Purpose Lock-Free Data Structure"



###Technical Skills

  * Good grasp of C++11/C++14 and Standard Template Library (STL)
  * Familiar with DirectX 9, DirectX 11 and OpenGL APIs
  * Have experience with HLSL and GLSL
  * Studied NVIDIA CUDA architecture and wrote a sample kernel
  * Experience with Java and JNI
  * Some knowledge of the Web technologies (PHP, JavaScript, HTML, a little of Perl)
  * A lot of experience with MySQL, a little with Oracle PL/SQL
  * Good understanding of classic multithreaded and lock-free programming
  * Able to look into assembly output and optimize programs for speed using SIMD extensions
  * Good math skills (linear algebra, differential calculus, trigonometry)
  * Worked with SVN and GIT
  * Used to Bash and Linux


###Work Experience

* **MAIR Industrial Group, Russia, Moscow, August 2004 - December 2005**

  Position: Software Engineer

  Support of an internal database client application written in C++. Fixed bugs and improved GUI.


* **RBC Media, Russia, Moscow, December 2005 - June 2008**

  Position: Software Engineer, later Senior Software Engineer

  Development of web applications based on Apache, PHP (and a little of Perl), MySQL stack. 
  Building interfaces in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

  Development of an extension module for Apache to gather stats in the C language.

  Lead a small group of developers (3 people).


* **Human Stem Cells Institute, Russia, Moscow, August 2008 - May 2011**

  Position: Software Engineer

  Worked on an internal project to develop an OpenGL 3D computer program to demonstrate to clients
  the effects of cosmetic injections. The development was in Visual C++.


* **Independent software Developer since 2011 up to now**

  Took a break from active career to try to develop personal projects. Tried to develop a 
  CMS (Content Management System) and launch a news web site, took part-time gigs, later 
  developed a Java app for Google Play Store (Color Throne). 

  Used that time to boost my C++ skills, got a deep understanding of new features in C++11.
  Also read a lot about computer graphics algorithms and rendering techniques, wrote a couple 
  programs, came up with a new anti-aliasing algorithm (*DFAA*). Got a good idea of lock-free
  programming and came up with a new lock-free data structure *atomic\_data*.
  

###Education

  Mathematics and Informatics, Moscow Engineering Physics Institute (MEPhi), incomplete.


###Certificates

  * [Zend Certified Engineer](http://www.zend.com/en/yellow-pages/ZEND004080) (LAMP software stack)

  * [Mail.ru C++ Silver Certificate](https://certification.mail.ru/certificates/819e345a-c9d5-405e-bbb2-04083208f9d8/en/)



###Projects and Publications

  * [Introducing DFAA anti-aliasing algorithm](http://alexpolt.github.io/dfaa.html)

    In this article I present a novel AA technique - DFAA. HLSL code and a Render Monkey project is 
    available on [GitHub](https://github.com/alexpolt/DFAA).

  * [atomic\_data: A Multibyte General Purpose Lock-Free Data Structure](http://alexpolt.github.io/atomic-data.html)

    Lock-free programming problems are described and a new general-purpose lock-free data structure
    is presented. A lot of code examples. Also an 
    [Android Studio (NDK) project](https://github.com/alexpolt/atomic_data) is available.

  * [A quick and easy way to print a float in base-10](http://alexpolt.github.io/print-fp.html)

    Floating point is an important topic in computer programming and in this article some clever
    way of printing out floating point numbers is presented.

  * [Color Throne - Brain Gymnastics (an android game)](http://alexpolt.github.io/color-throne.html)

    This is a simple game written in Java. Check it out on 
    [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=poltavsky.alexandr.colorthronefree).


###Language Skills

  * Native Russian
  * Advanced English
  * Beginner German
